# Local Storage JS App

This repository contains a simple web application demonstrating the use of JavaScript's Local Storage API. It provides a basic example of how to store and retrieve data directly in the user's browser.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Source code directory
  - **css/**: Styling files
    - **styles.css**: Main stylesheet
  - **js/**: JavaScript files
    - **app.js**: (If exists and used)
    - **script.js**: Main application logic
  - **index.html**: Main HTML file
- **README.MD**: This file

## Features

This application demonstrates:

- Storing data in the browser's local storage.
- Retrieving data from local storage.
- (Potentially) Basic state management using local storage (e.g., login/logout state).

## How to Use

1. **Accessing the App**:
   - Open the `src/index.html` file in your web browser.

2. **Interacting with Local Storage**:
   - (Describe specific interactions based on `script.js` functionality, e.g., clicking buttons to trigger local storage operations).
   - Check your browser's developer tools (Application tab -> Local Storage) to see the data being stored.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:
- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for functionality

It utilizes the browser's built-in `localStorage` object.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- No server-side components required (runs entirely in the browser).

## Getting Started

To run the application:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser.
